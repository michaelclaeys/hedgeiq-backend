TRADING RULES (UPDATED)
======================================================================

Dealer Score Thresholds (0-4 scale):
  3.5-4.0 = Strong structural level → Full size (1.0%)
  2.5-3.5 = Moderate level → 75% size (0.75%)
  2.0-2.5 = Weak level → 50% size (0.5%) or SKIP
  <2.0 = No structural support → SKIP

Greek Confluence Requirements:
  - Minimum 3/3 Greeks aligned for strong conviction
  - 2/3 Greeks = proceed with caution (smaller size)
  - Pay attention to WHICH Greeks conflict and why

Vol/OI Discretionary Interpretation:
  - Support (positive GEX): Prefer LOW vol/OI (stable)
  - Resistance (negative GEX): Prefer HIGH vol/OI (fresh) or SKIP
  - Use as confirmation, not hard requirement

Price Action Confirmation:
  - Wait for VWAP test or level touch
  - Look for rejection candles
  - Don't front-run the level

Stop Loss Management:
  - Support levels: -0.5% to -0.6% (accounts for shakeouts)
  - If breaks >0.6%, that's real breakdown → exit
  - Track in journal: how far did it wick vs actual breakdown
